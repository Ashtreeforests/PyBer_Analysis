# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis Overview

* Resoures: 
  * Python
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib

* Purpose
  * Use the above resources to analyze ride share data. Analysis was performed to heighten our understanding of PyBer ride share metrics by city types. This knowledge may be used for future projects to improve affordability and accessibility to additional cities or counties.


## Analysis Results

Overall, our analysis shows that rural cities have the least amount of drivers, rides, and total fares. Suburban cities are between rural and urban in the number of drivers, rides, and total fares. Urban cities have the highest number of drivers, rides, and total fares. 

The least amount of drivers, rides, and total fares seen in rural cities contrasts with the average of fare per ride and fare per driver. Rural cities haave the highest average of fare per ride and fare per driver. This contrast is also seen for urban cities. Though urban cities have the highest amount of drivers, rides, and total fares, they also have the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.

## Analysis Summary

Based on the analysis of the results of this study, here are the business recommendations we have to address the disparity between urban and rural cities. 

* Additional study focused on the compiling high-level reasons for the disparity between urban and rural cities. While there are a few assumed examples such as increased distance for drives initiating the increase cost of fares, it might still prove useful to derive data-driven facts regarding the reasons city disparity. 

* Assess if there is a need for the company to have an increased presence in rural cities. While the increased cost for rural city populations is likely not ideal for the population, it may not be a business change issue. The majority of the revenue is stil originating from urban cities as they have the highest need for this means of transportation. 

* Conduct a study focused exclusively on urban cities to determine the same data analysis for the highest need population to determine areas of improvement for affordability and accessibility.
